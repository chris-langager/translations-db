I want to say a few words to let you know what it was like to have India as a Grandmother.

My first memories of Nama were at her house in Alexandria.

She had a beautiful garden with a large front lawn.  On that lawn was a tall tree with a swing.  I remember how my dad would push me higher and higher on that swing, while Nama watched on in horror, yelling that was "too high!".

After the stress of the swing and dinner, you would get to take a bubble bath in her giant tub, complete with water jets.  She'd take you out of the tub, wrap you in a soft robe, and rub lotion on your feet.

When Nama moved to Edington, we would always drive down as a family for Christmas.  You would sit in her cozy, old, low cealinged living room with it's massive fireplace, throwing crumpled up wrapping paper in and watch the flames flare brighter.

When she moved to Hamilton, I'd drive out on the weekend to help out with yard work.  She'd come out of the house as you were wrapping up with cold iced tea and a pimento cheese sandwich.  If you had a birthday or christmas was coming up, she'd ask if there was something I wanted.  I'd usually say some piece of equipemnt that she had no idea what it was, but would get it anyway.  Remembering how scared she was of me in the swing, it's probably best that she didn't know the kinds of trips I was doing with what she got me, but it was nice to have a piece of her along with me.

When I moved away, we saw each other much less, but we'd talk on the phone some, even though Nama famously didn't like phone calls.  My sisters and I had a game where we would see who could talk on the phone longer with her.  Five minutes was considered a good score.  Though the calls were brief, it was great to be able to talk through things with her during some big life moments, like new jobs, getting married, and buying a house.

On of my last memories of Nama was just before she got sick.  I rode my bike to her house in Culpepper.  She made pimento cheese sandwiches, decided 4 o'clock was a good enough time for wine, and turned on Judge Judy.  We'd shout at the TV, judging the characters on the show, and mute the commercials while chatting about life.
